GameLedger is a simple **Solidity-based decentralized scoreboard** that lets players register and manage their game scores directly on the blockchain — no central authority, no database, just transparent on-chain data.

## 📖 Project Description

**GameLedger** is a beginner-friendly smart contract built on the **Celo Sepolia Testnet**.  
It demonstrates how to use **Solidity mappings, structs, and events** to create a decentralized application where each player’s identity and score are stored securely on-chain.

This project is perfect for those who are new to blockchain development and want to learn how to build, deploy, and interact with smart contracts on a public testnet.

- Lets registered players **update their scores** anytime.  
- Stores and displays player details **transparently** on-chain.  
- Provides a public **read-only leaderboard interface** using `getPlayer()`.
